This TP(Travaux pratiques: practical work) was prepared by Pr.Xavier Bay as part of the course _Exploratory statistics and mathematical tools_ from the _Data Science_ major at the _Ecole des Mines de Saint-Ã©tienne_, and done by me and my colleague Younes Gueddari.

The TP statement is the file _TP2.pdf_.

The main R file is _scriptTP2.R_.

Our report of the project is the file _TP_2_Benechehab_Gueddari.pdf_ (written in French).
